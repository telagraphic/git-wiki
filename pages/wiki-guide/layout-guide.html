<h1>Layout Guide</h1>

<p>
  If you want to build your own page, you'll need to know just enough html and css.
  All you really need to do is copy and paste from another page and edit the content!
  You just have to keep an eye out for un-closed tags.
  Every HTML element needs an opening and closing tag.
</p>

<h2>Creating a New Page</h2>
<p>
  The easiest way to create a new page is to copy and paste one of the templates from the page layout section.
  Or any other page that you fits your need.
</p>

<p>
  Next, you'll need to update the front matter.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wiki-guide/layout-guide/front-matter.png" alt="">

<p>
  The <b>layout</b> tells the page which template it will use.
  the <b>title</b> gives the page a title that will appear in the browser tab.
  the <b>permalink</b> is the page address. You'll always need a trailing slash at the end!
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-markup">
    ---
    layout: project
    title: Wiki Guide
    permalink: /wiki-guide/
    ---
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Now, you can start adding UI elements that fit your needs.
  Just copy and paste them into your page from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wiki-guide/style-guide">style guide</a>.
</p>

<h3>Images and Links</h3>

<p>
  Jekyll is a ruby gem, it has commands to build and a run a server, as well as some handy ruby variables
  that you'll see in the markup.  For instance, you'll reference an image like this:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-markup">
    {% raw %}
    &lt;img src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    {% endraw %}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The <b>&#123;&#123;site.baseurl&#125;&#125;</b> is a variable that is replaced with
  <b>/Nationwide/plt</b> when the site is built.
  Instead of having to type this address everytime, the variable holds this value.
  The rest of the path after that is the directory structure that goes to the <b>/img</b> folder.
  Take a look around, there are many directories in the <b>/img</b> folder organized similarly to the <b>/pages</b>.
  This makes it easier to find which images belong to which pages.
</p>
<p>
  Links follow the same pattern.  But there is a slight difference.
  Notice that after the <b>&#123;&#123;site.baseurl&#125;&#125;</b> the path is just <b>/wiki-guide/layout-guide</b>.
  If you look at the project directory structure it is <b>/pages/wiki-guide/layout-guide</b>.
  The <b>permalink</b> field in the front matter sets up this url scheme and will find the page with a matching path.
  You can have pages nested within many folders, but the path can be one level deep.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-markup">
    {% raw %}
    &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/wiki-guide/layout-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    {% endraw %}
  </code>
</pre>


<h2>Wiki Structure</h2>

<p>
  Jekyll uses a project set-up like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>_data</b>:  For long lists of information, create a <b>.csv</b> and loop thru them with a table.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>_includes</b>: the head, body, nav and other sections are isolated into their own components.
    When building the site, jekyll builds them into a single page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>_layouts</b>: each page inherits a template that has slightly different css rules and styles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>_site</b>: the built version of the website.  This is what gets published on github pages.
    It is the final version of the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>_config.yml</b>: set the project title and baseurl here.  Jekyll settings are configured here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>assets</b>: img, files, icons and search code is here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>css</b>: css styles are here, you don't need to edit these unless you want to change the look and feel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>js</b>:  javascript code is here.  Just leave it alone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>pages</b>:  where all the content and pages are stored, add new pages here!
  </li>
</ul>
