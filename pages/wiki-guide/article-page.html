<h1>Article Page Header</h1>

<h2>Section Header</h2>

<p>
  <b>Vertical Rhythm</b>, or the spacing and proximity of headers and sub-headers in relation
  to paragraphs and lists is useful for visually communicating what is related.
</p>

<p>
  Notice the space above and below the headers, there is more above and less below to
  visually convey associated content.  An equal distance above and below provides for a smooth
  read but doesn't show header to content relationship very well.
</p>

<p>
  Headers closer to their content shows a closeness, a relationship.  It's a subtle effect.
  White space between headers shows distance or a distinct grouping of information.
</p>

<p>
  Use <b>h2</b> headers for top level sections and use <b>h3</b> for sub-sections or mini-chapters
  for a topic.  These prinicples are coded for all elements on the page to provide a smoother reading
  experience.

<h3>Project Decomp</h3>

<p>
  What UI changes are happening, <a href="#">feed changes</a>, database table validation.
  Ask the dev what will I be validating? The UI, the database tables, or a report somewhere?
  Testers and Dev's give a point estimate for suggested cards.
</p>

<p>
  Most story cards never exceed 5 points. If they do, the card is too big.
  You should find scenarios to move into another card. Don't estimate an 8 point card,
  decompose it into smaller cards.

<h3>3 Amigos</h3>

<p>
  RA creates story cards according to the SRD Business Rules.
  RA get's approval from BAO for the story card. Look at the RA Board for story card status.
</p>

<p>
  Bring laptop and ask the RA or Dev where in the UI or database tables the test can be validated.
  Write your notes in the RTC card, these will be helpful for the tester who picks up the card later.
