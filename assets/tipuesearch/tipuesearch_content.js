Installing, configuring the gems and project setup is always problematic. You will run into issues more than likely. Ask a test lead or automation developer for help if you get stuck. Clone Build/Serve Github Search Index Push Process Clone the Repo Go to https://github.nwie.net/lyonsn1/git-wiki, clone or download the repository. This will copy the repo onto your local machine. Make sure bundler is installed, if not run: gem install bundler Next, install gems. The Gemfile tells us what gem's are needed for the project. bundle install If bundle install didn't work, you may need to update, try this then run bundle install again. bundle update Jekyll and all the other gems should be installed. gem list will list all the gems installed. gem list Build and Serve You'll need to run Jekyll from the command line. cd into the project directory and type: bundle exec jekyll serve This command builds and serves the site on your local host. Copy the server address path and paste into your browser. Every time you save a change, you'll see a regenerating statement. This allows you to run the wiki on your local machine and view the changes you make when editing the pages. Do this When starting your project, you should update the title and baseurl in the _config.yml file. Give it a name that describes what it is. title: PLT Wiki baseurl: \"/Nationwide/plt\" Hosting on Github Pages In order to host the website on github pages. You'll need to make your own repository for your project or team. Sign-in to github with your nationwide credentials. Looks complicated. You will need to change the origin from the address above to your own. git remote -v Run this command to point your repository address. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git Now you can push your local repository to github! Let's make some final changes to get it hosted. You will need to update the baseurl in the _config.yml file to match your user-name/project-name path. When you push your new changes, github will automatically build and update the website on github. Index Pages For the search functionality to work, you should run rake index to index new pages or update pages. This will add the new page and changes to the search index file. Tipue search is a javascript library that builds a JSON index of the website. It is located at /assets/tipuesearch/tipuesearch_content.js. Don't mess with it! Push Process In short, the commit process goes like this: rake index git add . git commit -m \"commit message\" git push origin master",

    "text": "Layout Guide If you want to build your own page, you'll need to know just enough html and css. All you really need to do is copy and paste from another page and edit the content! You just have to keep an eye out for un-closed tags. Every HTML element needs an opening and closing tag. Creating a New Page The easiest way to create a new page is to copy and paste one of the templates from the page layout section. Or any other page that you fits your need. Next, you'll need to update the front matter. The layout tells the page which template it will use. the title gives the page a title that will appear in the browser tab. the permalink is the page address. You'll always need a trailing slash at the end! --- layout: project title: Wiki Guide permalink: /wiki-guide/ --- Now, you can start adding UI elements that fit your needs. Just copy and paste them into your page from the style guide. Images and Links Jekyll is a ruby gem, it has commands to build and a run a server, as well as some handy ruby variables that you'll see in the markup. For instance, you'll reference an image like this: &lt;img src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt; The &#123;&#123;site.baseurl&#125;&#125; is a variable that is replaced with /Nationwide/plt when the site is built. Instead of having to type this address everytime, the variable holds this value. The rest of the path after that is the directory structure that goes to the /img folder. Take a look around, there are many directories in the /img folder organized similarly to the /pages. This makes it easier to find which images belong to which pages. Links follow the same pattern. But there is a slight difference. Notice that after the &#123;&#123;site.baseurl&#125;&#125; the path is just /wiki-guide/layout-guide. If you look at the project directory structure it is /pages/wiki-guide/layout-guide. The permalink field in the front matter sets up this url scheme and will find the page with a matching path. You can have pages nested within many folders, but the path can be one level deep. &lt;a href=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/wiki-guide/layout-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wiki Structure Jekyll uses a project set-up like this: _data: For long lists of information, create a .csv and loop thru them with a table. _includes: the head, body, nav and other sections are isolated into their own components. When building the site, jekyll builds them into a single page. _layouts: each page inherits a template that has slightly different css rules and styles. _site: the built version of the website. This is what gets published on github pages. It is the final version of the site. _config.yml: set the project title and baseurl here. Jekyll settings are configured here. assets: img, files, icons and search code is here. css: css styles are here, you don't need to edit these unless you want to change the look and feel. js: javascript code is here. Just leave it alone. pages: where all the content and pages are stored, add new pages here! Check out how to build, serve and host.",
