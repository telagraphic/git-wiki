# Issues

Need to install Node.js to fix.

# Build, Test and Deploy Instructions

## Step 1: Front Matter

Before you deploy to github, make sure any new pages or posts have the requisite front matter.
A title and a permalink at the very minimum will do.

``` html
---
title: page title goes here
permalink: /path/file/
---
```

Jekyll uses front matter during the build process, just add this to the very top of the page or post.
It goes before any html or markdown, else you will have build errors.

## Step 2: Test Locally

Run the project on your local machine to test your changes!
__bundle exec jekyll serve__

## Step 3: Build script

Before pushing changes to github pages, you'll need to re-index the search.
This is a json object file that uses tipuesearch.js to index all the pages in the project.
Run:

```
rake index
```

## Step 4: Deploy

Use the gh-pages branch to push.

```
git push origin gh-pages
```
