Text Sections Tables Lists Links Buttons Definition Lists Tabs Boxes Icons Text Sections Vertical Rhythm, or the spacing and proximity of headers and sub-headers in relation to paragraphs and lists is useful for visually communicating what is related. Notice the space above and below the headers, there is more above and less below to visually convey associated content. An equal distance above and below provides for a smooth read but doesn't show header to content relationship very well. Headers closer to their content shows a closeness, a relationship. It's a subtle effect. White space between headers shows distance or a distinct grouping of information. Use h2 headers for top level sections and use h3 for sub-sections or mini-chapters for a topic. These prinicples are coded for all elements on the page to provide a smoother reading experience. Hopefully... Vertical Rhythm Vertical Rhythm Vertical Rhythm Project Decomp What UI changes are happening, feed changes, database table validation. Ask the dev what will I be validating? The UI, the database tables, or a report somewhere? Testers and Dev's give a point estimate for suggested cards. Most story cards never exceed 5 points. If they do, the card is too big. You should find scenarios to move into another card. Don't estimate an 8 point card, decompose it into smaller cards. 3 Amigos RA creates story cards according to the SRD Business Rules. RA get's approval from BAO for the story card. Look at the RA Board for story card status. Bring laptop and ask the RA or Dev where in the UI or database tables the test can be validated. Write your notes in the RTC card, these will be helpful for the tester who picks up the card later. Tables Tables come into to types: Static or Data. Data tables allow you to use a YAML or CSV to populate the table from a file. Much easier for re-use and maintenance.
